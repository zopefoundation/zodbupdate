Changes
=======

0.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- Add option to store the rename rules into a file.

- Don't commit transactions that have no changes.

- Load rename rules from entry points ``zodbupdate``.

- Compatibility with Python 2.4

- Rename from ``zodbupgrade`` to ``zodbupdate``.

- Add 'verbose' option.

- Improve logging.

- Suppress duplicate log messages (e.g. if the same class is missing in
  multiple objects).

- Improve the updating process: rewrite pickle opcodes instead of blindly
  touching a class. This also allows updating pickles that can't be unpickled
  due to missing classes.
